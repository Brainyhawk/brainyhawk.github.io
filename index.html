  <p id="IntroTextHTML" type = "text" class="Para">"I am a native born Hoosier, and I've called it home my entire life. I attend Purdue University where I am studying engineering with a focus on mechanical. When I am not studying I can be found either watching Purdue sports or tinkering away with the weeks most recent project.

I've recently found myself learning more and more about law and programming. I believe both of these topics are vital in a field as large as engineering. I currently reside as the team lead of patent research and accruement for the Purdue EPICS CAR Team in protecting the intellectual property of the team. I also take and have taken multiple programming classes at Purdue to build a multitude of languages available to me including: Python, MATLAB, and C.

One of my favorite things to learn about outside of STEM is Linguistics and Etymology! Learning about how human languages have shifted and mixed with each other is something that just gets more interesting the deeper you dig. Linguistics can tell you so much about who ruled where when and what those people brought with them. One of my favorite examples is the word パン(pan), the Japanese word for bread. Looking at this word and comparing it to history, you can see that this is a result of the first Europeans to land in Japan being Portuguese! Since bread did not exist in Japan before this, they took the word for bread from them and the rest is history! Reasons like this is why I tried to take as many foreign languages as possible within high school, those being Japanese and Spanish.

I know a little bit about a lot, so lets talk!"</p>
